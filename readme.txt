Simulating macroeconomic agent based model by Delli Gatti et al. (2011), called BAM, and toy macro abm by Caiani et al. (2016). 
Furthermore, the BAM model ist estimated via the mixture densitiy networks (MDN) and latin hypercube sampling, as suggested by Platt (2022) and Delli Gatti & Grazzini (2020).
