Overall class structure: The class BAM_base contains the BAM model from Delli Gatti 2011. 
The inputs are the values of the simulation parameters and specific model parameters. The output of the simulation function is none, 
only simulates the entire model according to the parameter settings and produces plots.
The function BAM_estimate also simulates the model, but actually returns specific time series (e.g. gdp as numpy array)
